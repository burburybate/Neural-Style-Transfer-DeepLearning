### Project Overview

This project implements Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow and VGG19. Neural Style Transfer allows you to blend the style of one image with the content of another, creating artistic and visually appealing images.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/burburybate/Neural-Style-Transfer-DeepLearning/
   cd Neural-Style-Transfer-DeepLearning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   
   ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare your content and style images:**
   Place your content image (`content_image1.jpg`) and style image (`style_image.jpg`) in the directory `C:\Users\purvi\Desktop\nltk_data\content_image\content_image1.jpg`.

2. **Run the style transfer script:**
   Execute the script `style_transfer.py` (or your script name) to perform style transfer.
   ```bash
   python style_transfer.py
   ```

3. **Output:**
   After running the script, the generated output image (`output_image.jpg`) will be saved in `C:\Users\purvi\Desktop\nltk_data\output\output_image.jpg`.

### Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
